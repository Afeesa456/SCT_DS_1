# Gender & Age Distribution Visualization

This project demonstrates how to use **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to visualize demographic data using a **bar chart** and a **histogram**.

## 📌 Project Overview
The dataset contains:
- Names of individuals
- Gender
- Age

We create:
1. **Bar Chart** – to show gender distribution  
2. **Histogram** – to show age distribution with a density curve (KDE)

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset is created directly in the code as a Python dictionary:

| Name  | Gender | Age |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Arya  | Female | 22  |
| Rahul | Male   | 25  |
| Sneha | Female | 23  |
| Arjun | Male   | 27  |
| Priya | Female | 24  |
| Ravi  | Male   | 30  |
| Neha  | Female | 21  |
| Karan | Male   | 29  |
| Divya | Female | 26  |
| Amit  | Male   | 28  |

## 🛠️ Requirements
Install the required libraries before running the code:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
